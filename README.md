# Dmarc Report

This is a tKinter application to read DMARC XML files and display its
content in a human readable form.

## Dmarc Report tKinter

The master branch is the original Dmarc Report application created using
tKinter as a frontend. If there is going to be any more developing on
this application, it will be done on the kivy branch for estetical
reasons.

## Dmarc Report Kivy

I did a lot of the Dmarc Report Kivy fork work in this git repository.
For that reason there is a lot of reverts in the end of this commit
log on both the master, kivy and tKinter branches.
