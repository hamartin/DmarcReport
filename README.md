# Dmarc Report

This is a tKinter application to read DMARC XML files and display its
content in a human readable form.

## Dmarc Report tKinter

The Dmarc Report using tkinter development is no longer in active
development. Meaning if any new code is to be added to this small
project, then that development will be done in the master or kivy
branch.

The reasons for this is mostly esthetics, but also because kivy seems
to be more multi platform focused.

## Dmarc Report Kivy

I did a lot of the Dmarc Report Kivy fork work in this git repository.
For that reason there is a lot of reverts in the end of this commit
log on both the master, kivy and tKinter branches.

### Requirements

The kivy branch requires

    kivy 1.9.1
        I havent tested this code with kivy less than 1.9.1, but since
        the code doesn't do anything to much extravagant, there is a
        good chance earlier versions of kivy will work just fine.
