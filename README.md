# DmarcReport

A simple script that will parse an DMARC XML file and show the result in a
Tkinter graphical user interface.

## History

I added DMARC functionality to my own email server and started getting these
DMARC XML files in the mailbox. They were not complicated to read, but there is
a lot of noise in the files which can easily be avoided by showing them in a
different/better way.
